Known Issues
------------

The --preload option does not always work.  The preload1 test currently fails.

quick2 test will fail if you do not have static libc installed.

IFUNC on glibc.  glibc appears to have a bug related to specific IFUNC
ordering.  build_local_scope in glibc is processing depth first instead of
breadth-first processing as it should be.  The prelink-rtld version works
around this issue.  (Prelink-rtld is only available in the cross compile
version.)  See:

https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9131
https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=20488

ARM & PPC: both are currently failing the reloc8 and reloc9 tests.  The
issue has been traced down to the latest binutils being unable to link with
'-Wl,-z,nocopyreloc'.  This problem is not related to prelink, as the binaries
fail before being prelinked.  See:

https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10168
