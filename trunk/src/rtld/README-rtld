The rtld emulation is based on the system libc ld.so code.

The original version of this code was written by Daniel Jacobowitz in
2003.  It needed little modification/updating until recently (2011) when
new constructs, such as STB_GNU_UNIQUE, were introduced into the dynamic
linking.

The 2011 work was done by Mark Hatle and based on eglibc-2.13.  I
attempted to document all of the code that had origins in eglibc and where
the code originated from.

As eglibc continues to advance, similar resyncs will be needed over time.
Hopefully not such a dramatic resync will be required in the future.
